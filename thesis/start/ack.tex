It is with the deepest gratitude I salute Dr. Michal Young for his wisdom, guidance, forgiveness, and intellect. I thank him sincerely for our weekly meetings for which significant portions were devoted to chats about bicycles. I also thank Dr. Hank Childs for his seemingly inexhaustible generosity in taking on another student's senior project. I express to Dr. Rebecca Lindner appreciation for her constructive motivation to always improve my writing communication, bright attention, and encouragement to remain a scholar in the Honors College, well before this project had materialized and when I thought I had no chance of completing it. I am forever thankful to my three advisors for encouraging me to strive for the highest.
