I believe that I have designed an approach to these problems and have architected a simplistic solution that automates the steps described in the introduction. I hypothesize that Problem One is solved by the advent of combinatorial testing, which identifies most, if not all, of the test cases necessary for confidence in working software. My tool, Parmgen, has solved the second problem, translating the English description of a test case into a concrete format that can be used as input into the program. I ask the user for smaller, more simplistic descriptions of their input data, which requires less work than writing every data point by hand. Then I can use Python's random statistical distributions to generate those points and write them to a convenient location for the testerâ€™s use. This tool is written in the Python language, which is useful for prototyping the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of this tool. I call this entire pipeline GenSequence.
