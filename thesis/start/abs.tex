\indent\indent Many open-source software programs lack rigorous, wide-reaching testing. This is primarily because the testing process is deeply dependent on human invention and manual writing. Therefore, writing system tests is often avoided because of its financial and temporal expense on the software development lifecycle. However, the data for some system tests can be generated from statistical distributions that exhibit certain trends or patterns when interpreted in the context of the program. Therefore, this approach can tease out specific behaviors in the program that warrant being checked. This project aims to automate the creation of those data points to streamline the process of writing large test suites.
