It is with the deepest gratitude I salute Dr. Michal Young for his wisdom, guidance, forgiveness, and intellect. What an honor it has been to enjoy the time offered by a true polymath. Finally I thank him sincerely for a year of weekly meetings for which significant portions were devoted to chats about bicycles and coffee. I also thank Dr. Hank Childs for his seemingly inexhaustible generosity in taking on another student's senior project. I express to Dr. Rebecca Lindner appreciation for her constructive motivation to always improve my writing communication, her bright attention to detail, and her encouragement for me to remain a scholar in the Honors College, well before this project had materialized and when I thought I had no chance of completing it. I am forever thankful to my three advisors for encouraging me to strive for the highest.
