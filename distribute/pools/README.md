#Data pools

In this directory we keep some sources of random or representative data, in the form of files. 

## Names (firstname, lastname)

names.txt is a collection 100 alliterative names (firstname lastname) generated by [http://listofrandomnames.com/](http://listofrandomnames.com/)

These names all have the form firstname lastname. We should have some unusual names to use for testing, e.g., "Albert de la Montagne", "James von Garland", "Jimmy Jo Jameson III", "Arvind".  names.txt will do for programs that don't really do anything with names, but will not do for testing programs that manipulate the names.
